Subject: Junior QA / Web Scraping Engineer - Portfolio Demonstrating Provizual's Workflow

Hi Vanessa,

I'm reaching out about the Junior QA / Web Scraping Engineer position at Provizual posted through the El Paso Innovation Hub.

## Background

I'm currently an Industrial Electrical Technician at Schneider Electric (11+ years experience in industrial automation and systems), but I've been building AI research systems and automation tools through my side project, Celaya Solutions. I work Monday-Friday 3:30pm-12am and Sundays, so remote contract work would fit perfectly while keeping me grounded in El Paso.

## Why This Email Is Different

When I saw Provizual's tech stack—Playwright for scraping, NestJS backend, TypeScript-based automation—I realized I'd already built something directly relevant to your exact workflow. So instead of just telling you I could do the job, I spent today building a working demonstration.

## What I Built (Attached)

I created a **complete, production-ready web scraping system** that demonstrates:

✅ **Pattern-Based Scraping** - Exactly what you described: "copying and adapting existing scraper patterns"  
✅ **Playwright Integration** - Same browser automation tool Provizual uses  
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful selector failures, screenshot validation, detailed logging  
✅ **LLM Fallback** - AI-powered extraction when selectors break (using Claude API)  
✅ **MCP Server Architecture** - Modern protocol for AI-assisted development  
✅ **GUI Interface** - For non-technical team members to run scrapers  
✅ **Construction Industry Focus** - Pre-built patterns for construction data sources

**The attached project includes:**
- Full MCP server implementation (Python + Playwright)
- Desktop GUI application for QA team usage
- 5 working examples with construction-specific scenarios
- Comprehensive README with integration guidance
- Architecture diagrams showing Provizual integration path
- Setup script for one-command installation

## Technical Alignment

| Provizual Needs | Demonstrated |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Playwright expertise | ✓ Built entire system on Playwright |
| Pattern adaptation | ✓ 5 examples showing selector updates |
| NestJS/TypeScript background | ✓ 11 years industrial automation (similar systems thinking) |
| Automated testing mindset | ✓ Validation tools + error detection built-in |
| Construction industry data | ✓ Pre-built patterns for projects, materials, contractors |

## Why I Fit

**Systems Thinking**: 11 years troubleshooting industrial electrical systems translates directly to debugging web scrapers. Pattern recognition, systematic diagnosis, and failure analysis are the same skillset—just applied to code instead of PLCs.

**Learning Velocity**: I taught myself AI development, MCP protocols, and advanced automation while working full-time. Your mentorship structure would accelerate that growth trajectory significantly.

**Production Mindset**: I don't build demos—I build systems that run 24/7. The attached project has error recovery, logging, monitoring hooks, and deployment options because that's how I approach technical problems.

**El Paso Connection**: This position keeps me in my home city while working with a Dallas-based construction tech company. Perfect alignment with where I want to be.

## Next Steps

The attached ZIP file is ready to run:
```bash
unzip construction-scraper-demo.zip
cd construction-scraper-demo
./setup.sh
python gui.py  # or python server.py for MCP mode
```

I'd love to discuss:
1. How this approach could integrate with your existing NestJS scrapers
2. My transition from industrial automation to software development
3. Contract vs. full-time timing based on your immediate needs

Available for a conversation whenever works for your team. I can walk through the code, discuss the construction industry patterns, or answer any technical questions.

Best,  
Christopher Celaya

**P.S.** - The project demonstrates I understand Provizual's workflow. That's not accidental—I read the job posting carefully, researched construction tech data challenges, and built something that directly addresses your stated needs. That's how I approach problems: understand the system, then build the solution.
